# RideSnap-Make-Your-Ride-Easy
RideSnap is a real-time ride-hailing app inspired by InDrive, built to mimic core features like  location tracking, and booking rides with ease. The app allows users to set pickup/drop-off points, propose fares, and connect directly with drivers â€” just like the real InDrive experience.
